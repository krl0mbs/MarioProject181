Map Creator created by Clinton Rogers

Stuff for you to do to use it:
-install the latest version of java

How to use it:

	-To Run on windows machine double click the MapCreator.bat file
	-To Run on any machine: from a console window, traverse to
	that particular folder/directory and type the following
	"java -jar MapCreator.jar

	-Use it the same way you would Paint.  The icons on the right
	are your pallete and the small squares on the left is your 
	canvas.  The top half of the canvas is the first part of the level
	(start leftside, end right), the bottom half is a continuation
	of the top half (left to right)

	-Saving: When saving, give the file a unique name and click the save
	button.  Once that is done, your file will be in the "maps" folder.
	Transfer it from that maps folder to the Mario projects "maps" folder.
	From there you must follow The Mario Projects in-game directions to
	add the map to a level set.	

	-Special Icons:

		Warp Ahead: If the player gets to this point, they will skip
		the specified number + 2 levels ahead.

		Enemy: Enemies in a map are defined by a lower case letter.
		Depending on how many enemies are scripted into the game,
		you can use up to that letter.

		Blank Icon: Right above the Star/Coin icon is a blank icon.
		This is simply an invisible but solid block.
